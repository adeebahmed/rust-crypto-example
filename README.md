# rust-crypto-examples

Due to a lack of finding any simple usage examples of common cryptography algorithms in rust, I threw this together real quick. Feel free to add examples for other algorithms.


Assuming you have [cargo and rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) installed:

`cargo build`

`cargo run`
